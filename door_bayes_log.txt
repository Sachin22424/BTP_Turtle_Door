Door 1 (door1) at (4,5.5):
Prediction step:
  open = 0.8 * 0.500 + 1.0 * 0.500 = 0.900
  closed = 0.2 * 0.500 + 0.0 * 0.500 = 0.100
  eta = 1/(open+closed) = 1.000
  normalized: open = 0.900, closed = 0.100
Correction step:
  open = 0.6 * 0.900 = 0.540
  closed = 0.2 * 0.100 = 0.020
  eta = 1/(open+closed) = 1.786
  normalized: open = 0.964, closed = 0.036
  Passed through door1.
